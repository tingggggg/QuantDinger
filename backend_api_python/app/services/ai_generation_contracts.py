# Strategy API V2 contract

## Required structure
- Start with a triple-quoted docstring. Its first non-empty line is the strategy name; the following lines explain the universe, signals, schedule, and risk controls.
- Define `initialize(context)` and at least one executable handler or schedule callback.
- The strategy source owns the universe, market, instrument type, the exact data frequency or frequencies required by its logic, subscriptions, benchmark, schedules, and trading rules.
- The run panel owns only initial capital, the backtest date range, and an optional leverage value when the source explicitly permits leverage.

## Universe and market ownership
- Use canonical instruments such as `USStock:SPY`, `CNStock:600519.SH`, `Crypto:BTC/USDT@spot`, and `Crypto:BTC/USDT@swap`.
- For a fixed universe call `context.set_universe([...])`.
- For a platform universe pool call `context.set_universe(pool='sp500')` and obtain its point-in-time members with `get_universe_stocks()`.
- For an index universe call `context.set_universe(index='INDEX:NASDAQ100')` and obtain members with `get_index_stocks(...)` when needed.
- Call `context.subscribe(frequency='1d', fields=[...])`. Single-timeframe is the default: emit exactly one subscription unless the user explicitly requests cross-timeframe confirmation or the supplied strategy logic already reads several timeframes. For an explicit multi-timeframe strategy, call it once for each required timeframe (at most eight), preserve every requested timeframe, and never collapse `1d + 4h + 1h` into one subscription. Do not ask the run panel for a symbol, market, exchange, or timeframe.
- Use `context.set_warmup(bars)` for indicator history and `context.set_benchmark(...)` when a benchmark is meaningful.

## Event model
- CTA strategies implement `handle_data(context, data)`.
- Single-symbol signal strategies normally implement `handle_data(context, data)`. Do not add a schedule unless the user requests one or the strategy is explicitly a periodic portfolio rebalance.
- Portfolio strategies may register the global helpers `run_daily(callback, time="HH:MM")`, `run_weekly(callback, weekday=1, time="HH:MM")`, or `run_monthly(callback, monthday=1, time="HH:MM")` in `initialize` and rebalance inside the callback. These are runtime-bound global helpers; call them directly and never as `context.run_daily`, `context.run_weekly`, or `context.run_monthly`.
- Optional lifecycle handlers are `before_trading_start(context, data)` and `after_trading_end(context, data)`.
- Store per-run state on the global `g` namespace.
- Confirm decisions from visible completed data only. Never read future rows, use negative shifts, or otherwise introduce look-ahead bias.

## Parameters and metadata
- Declare tunable strategy knobs with `# @param <name> <int|float|bool|str> <default> <description>` and keep every declared default identical to the fallback used in code.
- Read run-supplied values only inside executable handlers or scheduled callbacks with `context.params.get("name", same_default)`. The discovery context used by `initialize(context)` has no `params`; never read `context.params` in `initialize`.
- Parameters may control signal periods, thresholds, target weights, stops, take profit, trailing protection, cooldowns, and bounded layer counts.
- Do not disguise universe, symbol, market type, frequency, leverage permission, initial capital, date range, commission, or slippage as ordinary strategy parameters.
- Use `context.set_metadata(...)` in `initialize` for stable descriptive metadata such as direction mode and strategy family, passing keyword arguments such as `context.set_metadata(direction_mode="long_only", strategy_family="trend")`. Metadata is not a substitute for executable risk logic.

## Data and factors
- Historical-bar signatures are exact: `get_history(count, frequency=None, field=None, security_list=None)` and the default form `data.history(symbols, count, fields=None)`. Multi-timeframe data views add the optional keyword `frequency=None` to `data.history`.
- Read the current scalar field with `data.current(symbol, field="close")`; multi-timeframe code may add the optional keyword `frequency=None`. There is no `get_current_data` API and `data.current(...)` does not return an object with a `.close` attribute.
- In `get_history(...)`, `count` is always the first argument and must be an integer. In `data.history(...)`, symbols are first and the integer count is second. Prefer explicit keywords when using `data.history`, for example `data.history(symbol, count=60, fields=["close"])`.
- A history request for one symbol returns a pandas `DataFrame` directly. Use `bars["close"]`; never index the result again with `bars[symbol]`. Multiple-symbol requests return a dictionary keyed by canonical symbol.
- Use `indicator(name, symbol, **params)`, `factor(name, symbol, **params)`, or `get_factors(symbols, names, **params)` for technical factors.
- TA-Lib indicators and factors are available through the registered 129-function adapter; use canonical TA-Lib names and valid parameters.
- Use `get_fundamentals(fields, symbols)` only for real point-in-time fundamental fields supported by the platform. Do not invent fields or use future reports.
- Use `get_index_stocks(reference)` for dynamic index constituents.
- Use `get_universe_stocks()` for the currently selected platform universe pool. Do not copy pool constituents into source code.
- Native strategy timeframes are exactly `1m`, `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`, and `1w`. Use these lowercase canonical literals in generated source. `1w` is weekly; monthly bars are not part of the current strategy contract.
- Every frequency requested by `get_history`, `data.history`, `data.current`, `indicator`, `factor`, or `get_factors` must be declared with `context.subscribe`. If the user explicitly requests `1d + 4h + 1h`, the strategy therefore has three subscribe calls and three explicit history reads.
- The fastest subscribed timeframe drives `handle_data`. Higher-timeframe bars remain invisible until their own close; never emulate them by resampling visible lower bars or by reading an unfinished candle.
- Guard the history length of every timeframe independently. Size `context.set_warmup(...)` for the largest required lookback, while retaining a separate `len(...)` guard for every returned frame.
- Only when cross-timeframe confirmation is explicitly requested, use the completed higher timeframe as the requested regime, trend, or crossover confirmation and the fastest timeframe as the execution clock. Preserve whether the request means higher-timeframe bullish alignment (`fast > slow`) or a fresh higher-timeframe crossover event; do not silently substitute one meaning for the other. Make low-timeframe order conditions idempotent so a persistent higher-timeframe state does not cause repeated scale-ins.
- Do not invent or subscribe to extra confirmation timeframes. A request naming one timeframe must remain single-timeframe. Conversely, do not silently replace an unavailable requested timeframe with a different one; generated code must compile against the exact source-owned subscriptions.

## Orders and positions
- Order-helper signatures are exact: `order(symbol, amount)`, `order_value(symbol, value)`, `order_target(symbol, amount)`, `order_target_value(symbol, value)`, and `order_target_percent(symbol, percent)`.
- These are runtime-bound global helpers. Never pass `context` as their first argument. Optional execution and protection values must be keyword arguments after the two required arguments.
- `get_position(symbol)` returns a `Position` object. Read `position.amount`, `position.avg_cost`, and `position.last_price` directly; never use dictionary membership, subscripting, `.get(...)`, or `getattr(...)` on it.
- A `Position` has no `.quantity` or `.cost_basis`; use `.amount` and `.avg_cost`.
- Use `get_positions(...)` when a dictionary of multiple positions is required.
- Values passed to value-based order APIs are quote-currency exposure targets. Keep sizing bounded by available capital and explicit allocation rules.
- Keep long entry, long exit, short entry, and short exit conditions independent. A bearish long exit is not automatically a short entry.
- Spot and all non-crypto markets are long-only for now.

## Contract leverage
- Leverage is supported only when every source-controlled instrument is a Crypto perpetual contract ending in `@swap`.
- A leveraged strategy must explicitly call `context.allow_leverage(max_leverage=N)` in `initialize`.
- The user may then choose a leverage value from 1 through the declared maximum in backtest or live setup.
- Never call `allow_leverage` for stocks, ETFs, futures outside the Crypto market, index universes, or Crypto spot.
- Do not hardcode the user's selected leverage inside order logic; the runtime applies the chosen leverage.

## Safety
- Bound loops and position sizes. Add explicit limits to pyramiding, grids, DCA, and martingale behavior.
- Do not use file, network, database, process, reflection, dynamic execution, or unsafe import APIs.
- Do not use `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `open`, `getattr`, `setattr`, dunder access, or unsafe imports.

# CTA workspace contract (single-instrument timing)
- This turn must produce a CTA manifest: one fixed canonical instrument, no dynamic universe, no basket, no `on_rebalance`, and no cross-sectional ranking.
- The source must call `context.set_universe([instrument])` with exactly one instrument and normally use `handle_data(context, data)`.
- `USStock:MSFT` means a US equity. It has no `@spot`/`@swap` suffix, is long-only, and must never call `context.allow_leverage(...)`.
- `Crypto:BTC/USDT@spot` means the exchange spot market. It is long-only, has no contract leverage, and must never be treated as a perpetual future.
- `Crypto:BTC/USDT@swap` means a Crypto perpetual contract. Long/short behavior and leverage are allowed only when the user explicitly requests them; leverage additionally requires `context.allow_leverage(max_leverage=N)`.
- Never convert `@spot` to `@swap`, never remove an explicit Crypto market-type suffix, and never replace a Crypto instrument with a stock fallback such as `USStock:SPY`.
- When an existing source or structured IDE context supplies the instrument and frequencies, preserve them exactly. The current source is the source of truth.
- A bearish exit from a long position is not a short entry. Only generate short-entry logic for an explicit Crypto `@swap` request with independently defined short conditions.
- The compiled result is accepted only when `manifest.strategyType == "cta"`.

PORTFOLIO_STRATEGY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = STRATEGY_V2_BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT + """

# Portfolio workspace contract (multi-instrument or dynamic-universe allocation)
- This turn must produce a portfolio manifest. Use either a dynamic universe reference (`pool=...` or `index=...`) or at least two fixed canonical instruments.
- Portfolio code must define an explicit selection/ranking/allocation process and rebalance through `on_rebalance(context, data)` or a registered global schedule callback. Do not emit a disguised single-symbol CTA strategy.
- For platform pools, call `context.set_universe(pool='...')` and obtain point-in-time members with `get_universe_stocks()`. For index universes, call `context.set_universe(index='INDEX:...')`; do not hardcode today's constituents.
- Fixed US-equity baskets use canonical identifiers such as `USStock:SPY` and `USStock:QQQ`. They are long-only and cannot call `context.allow_leverage(...)`.
- Fixed Crypto spot baskets use explicit instruments such as `Crypto:BTC/USDT@spot` and `Crypto:ETH/USDT@spot`. They are long-only; never silently convert them to perpetual swaps.
- A Crypto perpetual basket must use `@swap` on every member. Do not mix `@spot`, `@swap`, and equities in one generated portfolio unless the user explicitly requests a supported multi-market portfolio; even then leverage is forbidden unless every instrument is Crypto `@swap`.
- Default portfolio exposure is bounded long-only allocation. Target weights must be finite, non-negative, and sum to at most 1.0 before runtime leverage. Explicitly exit names that leave the selected set.
- Use completed point-in-time data only. Guard missing histories independently so one unavailable symbol cannot corrupt the entire rebalance.
- Never read `context.params` in `initialize`; resolve ranking, top-N, and target-weight parameters inside the rebalance handler or callback.

- `type='sell'` in a chart marker controls marker orientation and does not by itself mean short entry. Classify each marker as long entry, long exit, short entry, short exit, warning/wait, or visual-only before translating it.
- Preserve composite edge logic exactly and make order intent idempotent. Confirm on completed bars; the runtime performs next-bar execution.
- Remove visual-only parameters. Keep only signal, sizing, exit, and bounded risk parameters whose defaults match `context.params.get(...)` fallbacks.
- Default to long-only. Short logic is permitted only when the conversion request explicitly asks for it and the preserved instrument is Crypto `@swap`.

- Require a metadata docstring and `initialize(context)`.
- Require a source-owned universe and subscription.
- Require at least one executable handler or registered schedule callback.

- Do not expose universe, symbol, market type, frequency, leverage permission, initial capital, date range, commission, or slippage as ordinary strategy parameters.
- Use only Strategy API V2 data, factor, fundamental, position, and order APIs.
- Prefer `handle_data(context, data)` for single-symbol signal strategies. Use schedules only for an explicitly requested schedule or periodic portfolio rebalance.
- Schedule helpers are global calls: `run_daily(callback, time="HH:MM")`, `run_weekly(callback, weekday=1, time="HH:MM")`, and `run_monthly(callback, monthday=1, time="HH:MM")`. Never call them through `context`.
- Enforce exact history signatures: `get_history(count, frequency, field, security_list)` and `data.history(symbols, count, fields, frequency=None)`. A single-symbol result is already a DataFrame.
- Use `data.current(symbol, field="close", frequency=None)` for a current scalar field. Replace every `get_current_data` call; that API does not exist.
- Enforce exact order signatures such as `order_target_percent(symbol, percent)` and never pass `context` to a global order helper.
- Treat `get_position(symbol)` as a `Position` object with direct `.amount`, `.avg_cost`, and `.last_price` attributes. Never treat it as a dictionary or use `getattr`.
- Replace legacy `.quantity` and `.cost_basis` position access with `.amount` and `.avg_cost`.
- Preserve completed-data-only execution and remove look-ahead.
- Preserve native multi-timeframe subscriptions when requested: keep every user-requested timeframe, subscribe every used timeframe, let the fastest timeframe drive execution, and never expose a higher-timeframe bar before its close.
- Never add a new timeframe during repair unless it is explicitly requested or an existing history/factor read already requires it. Keep single-timeframe source single-timeframe.
- Canonicalize supported literals to `1m`, `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`, or `1w`; weekly is `1w` and monthly is unsupported.
- Repair undeclared literal reads by adding the matching subscription instead of rewriting every read to the driving timeframe. Do not collapse, resample, or otherwise erase requested higher-timeframe confirmation logic.
- Keep symbol, market, frequency, schedule, and universe in source code.
- Permit user-adjustable leverage only for Crypto `@swap` instruments and only after `context.allow_leverage(max_leverage=N)`.
- Reject leverage for Crypto spot and every non-Crypto market.
- Keep long exits separate from short entries and do not invent reversals.

- Do not use any strategy context, position, schedule, leverage, or order API.
- `output['signals']` are visual chart markers only and never place orders.
- Input is a pandas DataFrame named `df` plus a params dict named `params`; start mutable work with `df = df.copy()`.

- Declare tunable parameters with `# @param <name> <int|float|bool|str> <default> <description>` and read matching defaults through `params.get(...)`.
- Set `output = {'name': ..., 'plots': [...], 'signals': [...], 'layers': [...]}`.
- Every plot and signal data list must have exactly `len(df)` values. Use `None` for sparse values and never emit NaN or infinity.
- Plot types are `line`, `bar`, and `circle`; `histogram`/`column` alias to bar and `lamp`/`dot`/`point`/`scatter` alias to circle. Set `overlay` explicitly. All non-overlay plots from one indicator share one pane.
- A plot point may be a scalar or `{'value': number, 'color': '#RRGGBB', 'size': number}` for per-bar style. Prefer the canonical `value`, `color`, and `size` keys.
- A signal is active when its `data` list contains a finite non-zero numeric marker price for that bar. This finite numeric value format is preferred for consistent preview and notification monitoring. Static `text` or `textData` labels never activate a signal on their own.
- Signals may set `renderMode` to `events`, `points`, or `state`; prefer sparse numeric event arrays unless the requested visual is explicitly a continuous condition.
